## The-Cat-Project
### Web app using ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL

### I've been casually brainstorming this idea for a web app that gathers information about domestic cats. 

Being that I'm on break for a few weeks, I'm going to practice database modeling, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax with this project. Eventually, I would likely migrate the db and app to Microsoft Azure.
